  <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12pt">A circle is a <span style="color:#109528; font-size:24pt">SHAPE</span> consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. ~Wikipedia</p>
    
  <p style="font-family:verdana" ;="" "font-size:12pt";="">The circle is a <span style="color:#98B7E9; font-size:24pt"> UNIVERSAL SYMBOL</span> that represents the ideas of totality, wholeness, original perfection, the Self, the infinite, eternity, timelessness, and cyclic movement. It symbolizes God ('God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere' (Hermes Trismegistus)).</p>
    
  <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:12pt" ;="">Circles <span style="color:#E998CE; font-size:24pt">MAKE LIFE POSSIBLE</span>. Circles are intricate parts of nature. The sun and moon are circles. Time occurs in repetitive cycles in the form of days, months, years and seasons. ~Nina Jay</p>
